# Pi-Confectionery

Curated Ansible to modify images and sweeten many Pi's.

## Tenets

1. Image based deployments able to be loaded directly on an SD card and usable
   immediately are the best case scenario.
2. Once the Pi's are in production, they need to be maintained and reflashing
   is likely unacceptable.

To support and maintain 1) and 2), use Ansible to modify the image and also
update the Pi's live disks as needed.
